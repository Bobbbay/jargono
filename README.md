## Jargono

*Pronounced: yarg-oh-no*

Jargono, my toy language.

### TODO

 - [ ] Call functions (FnRef)
 - [ ] Functions don't support arguments (in the backend as well as the frontend)
 - [ ] Make sure we're using variables the right way - LLVM has built-in support for them but we're using a hashmap?
   - [ ] Test out what happens when we actually try to change variables. They are *variable*s, after all.
 - [ ] Add support for strings (parser & codegen)
 - [ ] stdlib

Nice things to consider:

 - [ ] Variadics
